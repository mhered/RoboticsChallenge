# Become a roboticist challenge

## Intro

This month of February I will be following @JohnVial 's [28-day robotics challenge]( https://becomearoboticist.com/). The program blends ideas from [teaching sprints](https://www.teachingsprints.com/), [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary), and the [build in public](https://buildinpublic.com/) manifesto. I will document the process and share daily progress updates and key learnings in this repo as well as this [twitter thread](https://x.com/aergenium/status/1888376092571967708) 

I will be documenting the process in this repo:  Learn more about the program here:: https://becomearoboticist.com/  

## Day 0

Day 0: Setting things up. The challenge's repo  provides a containerized environment very easy to setup. Leveraging WLS, docker and the Dev Containers VS Code extension eliminates the need to fiddle with dual boot, ubuntu or ROS installs version compatibility, or dependencies. 



Day 0: Setting Up ðŸ”§

The repo https://github.com/johnny555/bar_ws provides a containerized environment that leverages WSL, docker, and the VS Code Dev Containers extension. Super easy to set up, and no fiddling with Ubuntu dual boot, ROS version compatibility, or dependencies.

### Key learnings

* cool Windows setup using Docker and Dev Containers VS Code extension shows promise 
* great excuse for a first contact with OBS Studio 

### Sources

[Course](https://course.becomearoboticist.com/)

[Discord channel](https://discord.gg/WpUGZYqXQN)

### First install

1. Download  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it
2. Download [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) and install it - loong!
3. In Power Shell install WSL - long, and seems to require admin permissions:

```shell
> wsl --install
```

4. Restart the PC for changes to take effect

5. Run Docker (status should show: Engine running)

6. Launch an Ubuntu shell, clone the repo and open VS Code inside the folder

```bash
> ubuntu
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/johnny555/bar_ws.git
$ cd bar_ws
$ code . 
```

7. Install the Dev Containers VS Code extension
8. Open `bar_ws` folder in dev container. Ctrl+Caps + P > **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container**... The first time it takes a very looong time to set up 20Gb of virtual machine
9. Ctrl+Caps + P > **Run Task** > **Test Gazebo**
10. In browser, open the GUI: `http://localhost:6080/` and play with Gazebo

### Relaunch

Run Docker  (status should show: Engine running)

Launch VS Code inside the `bar_ws` folder. e.g Open terminal typing `wsl` in the Search bar:

```bash
$ cd bar_ws
$ code .
```

**Reopen** the folder in container (or Ctrl+Caps + P > **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container**... select `/home/mhered/bar_ws`  )

Ctrl+Caps + P > **Run Task** > **Test Gazebo**

In browser, open: `http://localhost:6080/`

Took actually a couple of days, played a bit with OBS Studio and made a video

## Kick Off

Works for Nexus

Krytn & MACI Coffee robot

Read "Atomic Habits" James Clear - sprint to change self perception

"show your work" - a record, as a way to appreciate what we learn and get noticed

tag john vial

roughly 1 hour per day then write and share what I learnt for 28 consecutive days

Days 0-9 - Krytn Coffee Robot - standard ROS navigation stack then extend it using FreeCAD (add a tray)

10-19 MACI robot arm - adding collision avoidance. Controlling a robot arm is complicated. Extend it with our own gripper then pick up a can from a tray

20-28 build your own robot - find something relevant to you and simulate it! Will provide templates.

Additional Bonus videos to extend: real robots, frameworks and templates, AI...

Join Discord!

7 daily tasks each week (do the task and post about it)

Play with github copilot can help get unstuck

Copilot

Pearce - Engineering degree. Did robotics without ROS (was extracurricular). Doing PM in navy

11 pax in the cohort



## Day 1

Key learnings: 

* the idea to scan real life environments using a phone app piqued my interest
* 

## Day 2

* can open a terminal inside the docker either through the GUI with terminator or in vscode dev containers clicking on the `+`icon 
* learnt about vcstool https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool

Krytn teleop task runs but the robot does not move, even though `/cmd_vel` topic has traffic. 

Task throws error "Failed to activate controller":

`/twist_stamper` subscribes to Twist messages in `/cmd_vel` and translates to TwistStamped messages which it publishes on `/diff_drive_base_controller/TwistStamped`  

```bash
$ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped

```

More intrigued with the docker and devcontainers
