# Become a roboticist challenge

## Intro

This month of February I will be following @JohnVial 's [28-day robotics challenge]( https://becomearoboticist.com/). The program blends ideas from [teaching sprints](https://www.teachingsprints.com/), [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary), and the [build in public](https://buildinpublic.com/) manifesto. I will document the process and share daily progress updates and key learnings in this repo as well as this [twitter thread](https://x.com/aergenium/status/1888376092571967708) 

I will be documenting the process in this repo: https://github.com/mhered/RoboticsChallenge

| Video | Day  | Title   | Highlights |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| [![Image](./Day00/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./Day00/assets/Day00.mp4) | [Day 0](./Day00/)  | [3 Ways To Get You Computer Setup With Robotics - The easy way, the hard way and the dangerous way](./Day00/README.md) | Setting things up. The [repo]([https://github.com/johnny555/bar_ws](https://t.co/zbIHhpvXrG)) provides a containerized environment super easy to setup. Leveraging WLS, docker and the Dev Containers VS Code extension eliminates the need to fiddle with dual boot, ubuntu or ROS installs version compatibility, or dependencies. |
| [![Image](./Day01/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./Day01/assets/Day01.mp4) | [Day 1](./Day01/)  | [The Right Way And The Wrong Way To Drive A Robot](./Day01/README.md) | Started off easy with some simple teleop in simulation. Two highlights: first, I loved the 3D-scanned real scene in Gazebo, way more immersive than your usual turtlebot tutorial. Second, I finally got the chance to test OBS Studio for video production. Check the video! |
