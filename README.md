# Become a roboticist challenge

This month I am following [Dr John Vial](https://x.com/johnvial) 's [28-day robotics challenge]( https://becomearoboticist.com/). 

The program blends ideas from [teaching sprints](https://www.teachingsprints.com/), [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary), and the [build in public](https://buildinpublic.com/) manifesto. 

I will document the process and share daily progress updates and key learnings in this repo as well as this [twitter thread](https://x.com/aergenium/status/1888376092571967708) 

| Video | Day  | Title   | Highlights |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| [![Image](./notes/Day00/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./notes/Day00/assets/Day00.mp4) | [Day 0](./notes/Day00/) | [3 Ways To Get You Computer Setup With Robotics - The easy way, the hard way and the dangerous way](./notes/Day00/README.md) | Setting things up. The [repo]([https://github.com/johnny555/bar_ws](https://t.co/zbIHhpvXrG)) provides a containerized environment super easy to setup. Leveraging WLS, docker and the Dev Containers VS Code extension eliminates the need to fiddle with dual boot, ubuntu or ROS installs version compatibility, or dependencies. |
| [![Image](./notes/Day01/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./notes/Day01/assets/Day01.mp4) | [Day 1](./notes/Day01/) | [The Right Way And The Wrong Way To Drive A Robot](./notes/Day01/README.md) | Day 1 started off easy with some simple teleop in simulation. Two highlights: first, I loved the 3D-scanned real scene in Gazebo, way more immersive than your usual turtlebot tutorial. Second, I finally got the chance to test OBS Studio for video production. Check the video! |
| [![Image](./notes/Day01_Bonus/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./notes/Day01/assets/Day01_Bonus.mp4) | [Day 1_Bonus](./notes/Day01_Bonus/) | [3D-Scanning And Importing Real Scenes Into Gazebo](./notes/Day01_Bonus/README.md) | I got trapped in this rabbit hole: scanning a real scene with [Scaniverse](https://scaniverse.com/), repairing the mesh in Blender and [Instant Meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes), making a simplified collision model in FreeCAD and importing it all into Gazebo |
| ![Image](./notes/Day02/assets/hacking.gif) | [Day 2](./notes/Day02/) | [How Robotic Systems Communicate And How You Can Listen](./notes/Day02/README.md) | Day 2 brushes up on basic ros2 CLI commands which came actually handy as I spent ages troubleshooting pesky issues that prevented running the Krytn teleop. In the end it had probably been me clumsily touching things from inside and outside the container who caused the problem in the first place. In the meantime, the "Hard way" (running ubuntu "baremetal", no containers) is still not working for me. |

| [![Image](./notes/Day04/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./notes/Day04/assets/Day04.mp4) | [Day 4](./notes/Day04/) | [Don't Let Your Robot Become Lost - How To Give It A Map](./notes/Day04/README.md) | Day 4: mapping Game City caf√© and exploring the contents of the launch files. I am now working bare metal in ubuntu 24.04, and it makes a difference: gazebo, rviz visualizations run smooth! |
| [![Image](./notes/Day05/assets/thumbnail.jpg)](./notes/Day05/assets/Day05.mp4) | [Day 5](./notes/Day05/) | [Self Driving Robot? How To Make A Robot Autonomous](./notes/Day05/README.md) | Day 5: ROS2 package Nav2 enables autonomous navigation. Under the hood, a global planner calculates the best route to the goal using a static global costmap, and a local planner constantly scans for obstacles near the robot in a local costmap, and updates the path to avoid surprises. |
