# Day09 - 3 Steps To Finding Problems To Solve With Wheeled Robots & How To Choose When You Have Too Many

[Video Day 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qts-iC2fEz0)

Task: think about the robot YOU are going to build. Find robots that are wheeled robot platform.

Each robot helps different people in different ways, senses the environment differently: 

* in what kind of environment it will operate?
* what will be the job?
* who will it help?
* how?
* what systems are onboard?

Where to find robots?

* social media
* google
* directories, e.g. http://roboausnet.com 

Wheeled robot is not boring!

* lawn mower
* autonomous forklift
* restaurant delivery robots 
* site construction mapping
* etc.

## Wheeled robots

A list of resources to dig deeper in the different configurations (2-wheel differential drive, 2 wheel skid steering, ackerman steer, mechanum wheels, etc) and their applications:

* [Common Steering Methods ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3G0sUz3_Jw)
* [Ackermann steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry)

Wheeled platforms are fast and efficient, simple, robust, low cost solution. 

## Commercial wheeled robots

Five examples of  successful commercial wheeled robots

## Wheels-on-legs Robots 

Main drawback of wheeled robots is that require a flat surface, and struggle in uneven or soft terrain, have difficulties negotiating stairs or steep ramps. Beyond suspension systems wheels-on-legs robots are becoming popular. A lot more complex and expensive but also very cool.  

Three examples:

## Space rovers

- Mars Rover [Perseverance Mars Rover Landing- Inside Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2tKigOPBU) 

NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab has released an open source scaled down version of the Mars rover made with off the shelf components for education use. Features the rocker-bogie suspension system and is fully customizable: [JPL Open Source Rover](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover ) | [JPL Open Source Mars Rover Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVlflYLpklQ)
