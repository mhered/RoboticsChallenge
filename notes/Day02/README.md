# Day02 - How Robotic Systems Communicate And How You Can Listen

## Intro

* Robot as system of systems: control, perception, navigation, task orchestration, each complex system with subcomponents and all must share info in real time
* ROS as Discord for Robots: a well structured, heavily moderated chat where nodes (single purpose, unitary programs) exchange information in predefined formats, by publishing and/or subscribing to channels dedicated to specific topics
* brushed up on basic ros2 CLI commands to explore an unfamiliar robot system: list nodes and topics, listen to a topic, graphing the system with `rqt_graph` . Beyond that: 

## Linux command line crash course

To open a terminal inside the docker 

* In VsCode with Dev Containers : **View** -> **Terminal** or CTRL + Ã± or clicking on the `+`icon 

* either through the GUI with click on Terminator in the VNC GUI

* A short intro to linux commands, arguments and (short hand and long hand) flags, the command prompt `<user>@<computer>:<directory>$`
* `bash` is a programming language!
* why both empty?

```bash
$ echo $ROS_DISTRO

$ echo $IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH

```

* sourcing from outside docker in windows yields the same error message of missing folders. Note:  `.bashrc` does not source for ros jazzy and the workspace (`. install/setup.bash`) or set variables

* learnt about `vcs` tool https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool to manage version control of multiple repos (??)
* fun futuristic command prompt: https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui

## Troubleshooting

The refresher on ros2 CLI commands was helpful to troubleshoot because Krytn teleop task runs but the robot does not move, even though `/cmd_vel` topic has traffic. 

Task throws error "Failed to activate controller":

````bash

My conclusion after a couple of days struggling:

- Recovered the error by running **purge** + **build** tasks iaw John in the Discord **purge** task deletes `install`and `build` folders and then **build** forces to rebuild and repopulate the folder structure inside the docker which I probably messed up calling colcon from outside the docker in the first place. 
- Apparently the repo is symlinked so it can be accessed both from inside or outside the container, but the path is different in eahc case.  Worth trying **purge** + **build** to see if this fixes ubuntu
- may want to add a 3s `TimerAction` to the `joint_state_broadcaster` spawner in `gazebo.launch.py` as proposed in the Discord by Danial Othman. 

- More and more intrigued with docker and devcontainers

## Important note

`/twist_stamper` subscribes to Twist messages in `/cmd_vel` and translates to TwistStamped messages which it publishes on `/diff_drive_base_controller/TwistStamped`  

```bash
$ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped
```

## Bonus

A couple of tools beyond the old `rqt_graph` to interrogate an unfamiliar ROS2 system

Insight - a modern, user-friendly GUI for ROS 2

Current GUI Features

The application already supports several core functionalities for interacting with ROS2:

 \- Viewing Nodes: Display detailed information about running nodes  (similar to ros2 node list and ros2 node info), including their topics,  services, and more.

 \- Viewing Topics: List all topics (similar to ros2 topic list),  inspect details of specific topics (similar to ros2 topic info), and  view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Services: List all services (similar to ros2 service  list), inspect specific services (similar to ros2 service info), and  view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Actions: List all actions (similar to ros2 action list), inspect specific actions, and view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Message Definitions: Access detailed message structures, including raw definitions. This was the first feature developed and the original motivation for creating the GUI.

 \- Viewing Transformations (TFs): Visualize all coordinate frames  and calculate transformations between frames (similar to ros2 run  tf2_ros tf2_echo source_link target_link).

Key GUI Features

 \- Filtering: Each page includes robust filtering options for quickly finding relevant content.

 \- Navigation: User-friendly navigation, no menu bar.

 \- Nested Pages: Navigate through nested message definitions.

 \- Copy Button: Simply press a button to copy relevant content  (like the command to execute a node, eg. ros2 run turtlesim  turtlesim_node)

 \- View Online: See a message definition in the browser.

 \- Open folder: Open the folder of a package.

ros_network_viz This is a utility to visualize the state of an  entire ROS 2 network in a graphical way. This utility will show all of  the nodes in a graph, all of the topics, services, and actions that  connect them, as well as some additional metadata about them.

ROSboard is a node that turns your robot into a web server to visualize ROS topics

Danial Othman mentioned in the Discord he saw ROSboard in use in the nanosaur project (https://nanosaur.ai/) by Rafaello Bonghi and decided to install it into the BAR container and run it as part of ros2 package.
