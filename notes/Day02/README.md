# Day02 - How Robotic Systems Communicate And How You Can Listen

* can open a terminal inside the docker either through the GUI with terminator or in vscode dev containers clicking on the `+`icon 
* learnt about vcstool https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool

### Troubleshooting

Krytn teleop task runs but the robot does not move, even though `/cmd_vel` topic has traffic. 

Task throws error "Failed to activate controller":

````bash
[...]

$ ros2 topic info /cmd_vel

```

`/twist_stamper` subscribes to Twist messages in `/cmd_vel` and translates to TwistStamped messages which it publishes on `/diff_drive_base_controller/TwistStamped`  

```bash
$ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped

```

More intrigued with the docker and devcontainers

Insight - a modern, user-friendly GUI for ROS 2

Current GUI Features

The application already supports several core functionalities for interacting with ROS2:

 \- Viewing Nodes: Display detailed information about running nodes  (similar to ros2 node list and ros2 node info), including their topics,  services, and more.

 \- Viewing Topics: List all topics (similar to ros2 topic list),  inspect details of specific topics (similar to ros2 topic info), and  view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Services: List all services (similar to ros2 service  list), inspect specific services (similar to ros2 service info), and  view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Actions: List all actions (similar to ros2 action list), inspect specific actions, and view message definitions.

 \- Viewing Message Definitions: Access detailed message structures, including raw definitions. This was the first feature developed and the original motivation for creating the GUI.

 \- Viewing Transformations (TFs): Visualize all coordinate frames  and calculate transformations between frames (similar to ros2 run  tf2_ros tf2_echo source_link target_link).

Key GUI Features

 \- Filtering: Each page includes robust filtering options for quickly finding relevant content.

 \- Navigation: User-friendly navigation, no menu bar.

 \- Nested Pages: Navigate through nested message definitions.

 \- Copy Button: Simply press a button to copy relevant content  (like the command to execute a node, eg. ros2 run turtlesim  turtlesim_node)

 \- View Online: See a message definition in the browser.

 \- Open folder: Open the folder of a package.

ros_network_viz This is a utility to visualize the state of an  entire ROS 2 network in a graphical way. This utility will show all of  the nodes in a graph, all of the topics, services, and actions that  connect them, as well as some additional metadata about them.
