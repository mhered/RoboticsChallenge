Making a video

1. Screencast the background using GNOME screen recorder CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R
2. assemble `DayNN_bkg.mp4` in Shotcut. No sound, speed up if necessary. Target 66"
3. Improvise a voice over, transcribing it with iphone
4. Paste it in ChatGPT and ask to review with this prompt:

```
Help me make a video voiceover based on the first draft I will post next. 

For context this video will be part of a 28-day robotics challenge I am doing. My goal is to dive deeper into robotics -especially ROS2- through a hands-on approach. I am posting daily on twitter 1' videos with progress updates, highlights and take aways. Sharing daily helps me: Stay accountable, Track progress and Connect with the robotics community. 

Note that there may be mistakes in the draft because I am not a native English speaker and it is an automatic transcript. Please review the flow, make it informative, fresh and engaging and 1' long.

Afterwards, help me as well write a short fresh twitter cover post to go with the video. 
```
